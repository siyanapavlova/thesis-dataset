        "content": "Animation is a way of making a movie from
many still images. The images are put together one after another,
and then played at a fast speed to give the illusion of movement.
\nAnimation is a relatively new art form, and though the concept of
moving images has been a theme throughout ancient civilizations, it was not
until late into the 19th century that experimental animation truly began. 
Today, the industry of animation is booming, making up a huge commercial enterprise. 
\nA person who makes animations is called an animator. \nThere are three ways to
animate:\n\nDraw each frame\nUse stop-motion: make a model scene and change
it to create a new image (frame)\nMake computer graphics",
