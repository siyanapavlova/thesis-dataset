        "content": "Accounting or accountancy is the job of sharing financial information about a business to managers and shareholders (people who have invested in the business). Accounting is often called the \"language of business\". Accountants are people who do accounting, and also carry out the auditing or checking of a company's books and records. In Britain, this auditing is often carried out by a qualified person called a \"chartered accountant\". In the United States, the professional designation is Certified Public Accountant or \"CPA\". When accountants do accounting work, they write in the books of account (ledgers) that belong to a company. Every time money is spent or earned, it is written in the ledger. The information in the ledger is used to prepare the company accounts monthly, quarterly (every three months) and annually (every year). These annual accounts show what money the company has taken in over time and what it has spent money on. It also shows if the company made a profit in the year (if it made more money than it spent), who owes the company money, who the company owes money to, and any big expensive items the company has bought which they expect to use for many years. Lenders, managers, investors, tax authorities (the people who collect taxes for the government) and other decision-makers look at these annual accounts. Managers and investors look at the ledger and make decisions about how to spend money in the future. Lenders like banks look at the accounts before they lend money to the company. Tax authorities look at them to check that the company is paying the correct amount of taxes.",

People who cannot reach this standard will be supported, usually by the state. Using welfare, everyone has their basic needs covered. This idea is different from the idea of charity.\nWelfare can take different forms:\n\nCertain goods are subsidized by the state. In that way, in many countries the price of goods people need daily, such as bread or rice may be fixed by the state.\nA voucher is similar to a subsidy, except that it may only be used in a certain way. An example of this might be the cafeteria at the university; certain students get their meals cheaper, because they have a voucher. The cafeteria then exchanges the voucher, and will be paid the difference.\nIt is also possible to pay money directly: people will then get a monthly amount of money. They can spend this money on anything, without restriction.\nSome countries need to have proof you applied for a job to receive welfare.Welfare money is given by the government, charities, and other groups of people to help homeless, old, illness, poor, and disabled people (people who cannot help themselves), and also helps children (child support).\nWelfare can also be called the well-being of someone or a group of people: their happiness, health, safety, and fortune.\nIn countries like Germany, Japan, United States, Sweden, and France, government welfare also is used to help the needy.",

        "title": "Capitalism",
        "content": "Capitalism is an economic system. In it the government plays a secondary role. People and companies make most of the decisions, and own most of the property. Goods are usually made by companies and sold for profit. The means of production are largely or entirely privately owned (by individuals or companies) and operated for profit.Most property, for example, is owned by people or companies, not by the government or by the workers. Capitalism has a more or less free market economy, which means that prices move up or down according to the availability of the products. People buy and sell things according to their own judgment. In most countries there is some regulation (trade laws) and some planning done by the government. They are sometimes called \"mixed economies\" to indicate this. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea.\nThe word comes from \"capital\", meaning something of value. This can be money (\"financial capital\") or any other goods that can be traded. The word \"capital\" originally comes from the Latin word \"caput\", meaning \"head.\" It was used to mean how many \"head\" of cattle a rich person owned, in days long ago when cattle were used as money. In fact, the words \"capital\" and \"cattle\" both come from \"caput\".\nThe philosopher Adam Smith's book, The Wealth of Nations, was an important book that developed the ideas of capitalism and the free market. The word \"capitalism\" was not used until the 19th century. The greatest invention of capitalism is often said to be the joint stock company. A joint-stock company is a business where different stocks can be bought and owned by shareholders. Each shareholder owns company stock in proportion to the number of their shares.",

A corporation's status and capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation.\nInvestors and entrepreneurs often form joint stock companies. Therefore, the term corporation often means such business corporations.

Condominiums are a common kind of non-profit corporation.\nIn common speech, the word \"corporation\" refers usually to limited responsibility corporation.

This type of trade has been growing rapidly because of the expansion of the Internet.\nThe need for electronic commerce emerged from the need to use computers more efficiently in banks and corporations. With the increasing competition there was a need amongst organizations to increase customer satisfaction and information exchange. Electronic commerce started with the introduction of electronic funds transfer (EFT) by banks.

People call the book just The Wealth of Nations. It stated some of the ideas on which modern economics is based off, especially market economics.In the Wealth of Nations Adam Smith asks 'what can a person do that is best for his country?' He decides that if every person does what is best for themself and their little circle of family and friends, then the country will do better. This is because every person knows a lot about their own situation (what they need and what they want, what works and what does not work), much more than the government knows. This sort of thinking is called \"liberal theory\", a main part of liberalism.\nHe was also a philosopher who wanted to know why people thought (felt) that some things are good and others bad. \nHe wrote an earlier book, in 1759, called The Theory of Moral Sentiments. He thought that empathy was very important in ethics. Empathy is when you see how someone else is feeling, imagine what it feels like, and then end up feeling the same way: for Smith, empathy is like \"putting yourself in someone else's shoes\". For example, empathy makes us feel happy to see someone else who is happy, or feel sorry for someone who is sad. Empathy may even make us feel pain when we see someone in pain (as if we had been hurt or affected). Both Smith and his friend David Hume, who was another Scottish philosopher, wrote about the importance of sympathy in ethics.",

A 'good' in economic usage does not necessarily mean that the object is good in a moral sense. \nIf an object or service is sold for a positive price, then it is a good since the purchaser considers the utility of the object or service more valuable than the money. Some things are useful but not scarce such as air and are referred to as free goods and common goods. \nIn macroeconomics and accounting, a good is contrasted with a service. A good here is defined as a physical product that one can deliver to a buyer. The service is not an object, but an action that benefits someone. A more general term that preserves the distinction between goods and services is 'commodities'. In microeconomics 'good' is often used in this more inclusive sense of a commodity.",

People then send an application. This usually includes a curriculum vitae, which is a summary of what a person has done until now in their life. The best applicants are selected and they come for an interview. This might also include some further tests or exercises to do. The person chosen is then given an offer of a job. Finally, they can choose to take it or not.\nThere are many ways of doing recruitment. Some companies go to consultants, who know where and how to find the best people. Universities and schools often have a group of people that tells the students about getting a job. At other times, a company might really want a person that is very good at a job but works for another company. They can then ask directly to this person, maybe offering more money.

A monopoly usually happens when there is no economic competition to produce the product or service and there is no available substitutes to the product or service.\nIn economics, a monopoly is a single producer of a product or service. In law, a monopoly is a firm that has a lot of market power and is able to charge very high prices for a product or service. As long as the firm has a lot of market power, it does not matter if the firm is large or small, as size is not used to decide if a firm is a monopoly.\nA monopoly can be formed by the government, by merging a few firms to form a large one, or form naturally to become a natural monopoly. In many places, utilities such as telephone service or cable television are monopolies, as it is very costly to build the infrastructure for another firm to compete in the market. Such natural monopolies is hence allowed by the government, but is usually strictly controlled to prevent the monopoly from charging a very high price for a product or service.\nMany countries, including the United States, have laws to stop companies from having a monopoly or to limit the actions that they can do as a monopoly.",

Examples:\n\nTwo hostile nations both claim a piece of territory. They may go to war over it. Or, they may negotiate some agreement. The agreement would be written down, and both governments would agree to keep the agreement.\nA football club wishes to buy a player from another club. A series of negotiations would take place between the clubs, the player and the player's agent. If the negotiations succeed, the player gets moved. In this case, and in many others, success is followed by a legal contract, or a court decision, which makes the agreement legal.\nIn less formal circumstances, a negotiation is just bargaining or haggling over, for example, money.",

People then send an application. This usually includes a curriculum vitae, which is a summary of what a person has done until now in their life. The best applicants are selected and they come for an interview. This might also include some further tests or exercises to do. The person chosen is then given an offer of a job. Finally, they can choose to take it or not.\nThere are many ways of doing recruitment. Some companies go to consultants, who know where and how to find the best people. Universities and schools often have a group of people that tells the students about getting a job. At other times, a company might really want a person that is very good at a job but works for another company. They can then ask directly to this person, maybe offering more money.

Prices go up when supply is less, and demand is more. It follows the law of demand where as price increases, demand decreases and vice versa showing an inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price. This is known as the law of demand which assumes that the consumer will want more. Demand forecasting tries to predict how demand will change in the future.\nSometimes the demand does not change much no matter what the price is. One example is when people are addicted to illegal drugs.  These people need to get their drugs, they will pay any price they can afford. This effect is known as elasticity.",

In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments, the NGO maintains its non-governmental status and excludes government representatives from membership in the organization. \nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial, since, according David Rieff, writing in The New Republic, \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"Unlike the term intergovernmental organization, \"non-governmental organization\" is a term in general use but is not a legal definition.

In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. But many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society, they have resulted in conflict. To prevent this, in most countries today, laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed peoples. Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail. Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do. An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.\nA legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced. This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments. A lawyer, jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - \"transcriptional\" attorneys who write contracts and \"litigators\" who go to court. In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively.\nThe Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a government has, as agreed in a country's constitution. The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. \"The rule of law\", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, \"is better than the rule of any individual.\"\nCulture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits. In many countries throughout history, religion and religious books like the Vedas, Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law.",

The business owner is the person who hires people for work. A business can earn a profit for the products and services it offers. The word business comes from the word busy, and means doing things.It works on regular basis.\nOriginally, individual trades people were qualified, and they hired assistants. The invention of the joint-stock company meant a new era in business. By this means, some people put up the money as capital, and others used it to run the business. There is a law which says this kind of company is a \"legal entity\": it has a legal life separate from its owners or shareholders. In this way, a company can outlive the people who started it. This idea was invented in medieval times, but really flowered in the 19th century. It has spread around the world since then.\nMost businesses are created for commerce. There are big and small businesses. For example, one person can open a small barber-shop. A big business, like Microsoft,  employs thousands of people all over the world.\nSome businesses need fixed locations. Examples are an office, store, or farm. For some businesses the worker goes to different locations. Examples are carpenters or electricians. They usually bring everything they need for work in their truck.\nBusiness can also mean the work or current state of a business. A business owner might say: \"I am doing a lot of business\" or \"My business is good\" or \"Business is bad\".\nThe term can also be used in a more general way. As a noun, it can be used, for example, to speak about a broad area of activity.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Deflation means that generally the prices of products are going down. It is the opposite of inflation. It is said, that deflation happens when there is less money than there are goods. It is also said that deflation is a sign of a weak state of that country's economy, because deflation usually happens during an economic collapse. Deflation is thought to be even worse than inflation.\nDeflation starts when people are waiting for prices to go down even more. They will then spend less money. Because of that, companies can not afford to keep up the amount of goods that are made, and have to lower that amount, as well as fire workers to make even a small profit.\nEven if an economy is growing, there can be some amount of deflation - if the amount of money going around grows slower than the making of goods. There has not been much deflation in the world since the 1930s, except in Japan.\nDeflation can be helped by the country's own government by lowering the companies' tax levels, so they can lower their prices while getting the same profit. This way normal people are more encouraged to buy the cheap goods they were waiting for, and slowly the companies can make more profit. Governments do not like deflation, because it means that they can collect less tax.",
