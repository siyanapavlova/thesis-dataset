He was the most important composer in Italy at the end of the Baroque period. \nVivaldi wrote more than 400 concertos for various instruments, especially for the violin. The scores of 21 of his operas, including his first and last, are still intact. His most popular work is the group of four violin concertos called \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d.  Each concerto describes a season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. He is believed to be the inventor of the ritornello form. He was very famous for his piccolo compositions, such as Il gardellino.",

People often use backpacks on camping trips, hikes, or any form of outdoor activity where people need to carry many things. Backpacks are also be used in the military by soldiers. It can be also used in school, or in this case, it also called a bookbag or school bag. \nLarge backpacks, used to carry loads over 10 kg (22 lbs), and smaller sports backpacks, usually offload the biggest part of their weight onto padded hip belts. This leaves the shoulder straps mainly for keeping the load in place. This makes it easier to carry heavy loads, because the hips are stronger than the shoulders. It also improves agility and balance, because the load lies closer to the center of mass of the person wearing it. \nIn the very distant past, backpacks were to carry hunters' larger catches. If the hunts were even larger, the hunters would cut their prey into pieces and hand out the pieces to other hunters. The hunters would then carry smaller pieces separately. The bag would be made up of animal skin and sewn together by animal intestines. They would then be woven together tightly to make a firm material. \nSome backpacks are specialized to carry a particular thing, such as fluids or a laptop computer.",

Backpacking travel type minimizes the cost by choosing cheap accommodation, such as youth hostels. One of the popular ones is Youth Hostels Association (YHA). Many hostels are registered with YHA and they have common standards. Depending on room types and season, the cost varies from $10 to $60 per night. Sometimes Backpackers while on a long journey, book accommodations at low rate and stay as a paying guest. Portals like airbnb.com, isearchrentals.com accumulates such kind of paying guest accommodations which helps backpacking travelers choose their stay at low costs.\nBackpackers are highly connected to each other. They get information not only from the internet, but also from a bulletin board of their accommodation, Backpackers. They share their information how to get to the destination wisely and about shops or restaurants on the bulletin board. Some backpackers depends on couch surfing, not spending money on accommodation, visiting local people's house.

They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies.\nBackpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared.\nWhen following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world.",

They are made of a pair of matched telescopes that are held in front of the user's eyes. \nThe two telescopes have lenses that focus light and magnify the image, a process called magnification. This way, when someone looks through the binoculars at a far-away object, it looks much closer. \nEarly binoculars had two Galilean telescopes without prisms. Modern ones have prisms inside, which fold the light path to shorten the length of the tubes. That is why a binocular is shorter than standard telescopes of similar power.\nBinoculars were invented in the 17th century. They allow a telescope user to use both eyes.  The Royal Navy used single telescopes, but now all ships have heavy binoculars.  Heavy ones can be mounted on swivels to scan the horizon.  Binoculars are also standard issue in all armies.  Night vision binoculars use photocathode electronics to intensify the image.\nBinoculars are also used for theatre (opera glasses), birdwatching  amateur astronomy and watching scenery.",

They can include many lanes of traffic, a median (strip of lane or barrier) between lanes of opposing traffic, and access control (ramps and bridges). Highways can also be as simple as a two-lane road.\nIn many countries, these roads are numbered to easily tell them apart. These numbered highways are usually called routes. The United States includes a system called the Interstate Highway system, controlled by AASHTO, where major north/south routes are odd numbered and east/west are even numbered. In Canada, routes that are in the 400s are freeways. In China, types of routes are separated by the first letter of the route; \"G\" for national road, \"S\" for provincial road and \"Y\" for rural roads.\n\nHighways are sometimes criticised because of the pollution cars make when driving highways. When too many cars travel along a highway, traffic slows down; this is known as a traffic jam. Public transportation (such as buses) and special lanes for those who have a given number of people in a car are used to help stop these problems.",

This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map.\nPeople who make maps are cartographers.\nMany maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records. \nIf a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected.  This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat.  There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections.  The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere.  This is called a globe.",

But the idea of protecting areas from human development was proposed years earlier. American painter George Catlin offered the idea during the 1830s.An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined National Parks as its category II type of protected areas. The largest national park in the world meeting the IUCN definition is the Northeast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974.

Ocean liners are used for transportation. Cruise ships are different, they are used for pleasure. \nThe \u201cgolden Age\u201d of the ocean liner was the first half of the 20th Century, when ocean liners commonly carried hundreds upon thousands of poor immigrants from Europe to North America, the United States especially. Hundreds of ocean liners were built during this period.  \nWhen WW2 started in 1939, many ocean liners were turned into troop ships, to transport soldiers to Europe and Asia, by both sides. After the war, most remaining ocean liners were returned to their original owners. \nIn the second half of the 20th century, ocean liners have been replaced by aircraft more and more. In the 1950\u2019s, as airplanes like the De Havilland Comet and Boeing 707 were built, ocean liners seemed redundant as jet liners were faster and easier to build than ocean liners. By the 1980\u2019s, most ocean liners had been retired with only a few outliers staying in service.",

The Southern ocean is also called the Antarctic Ocean, because it covers the area around Antarctica. Older maps may not use the names Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean. \nThe deepest ocean is the Pacific ocean. The deepest point is the Mariana Trench, being about 11,000 metres (36,200 feet) deep. The deep ocean is characterized by cold temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. Some very unusual organisms live in this part of the ocean.

Passports are used so a stamp can be placed in it to prove that the identity of the holder has been confirmed with the immigration officials in the country of travel.\nIn 1920, the International Conference on Passports, Customs Formalities and Through Tickets made a law that said passports must be issued in French and at least one other language.

It reduces sunburn and other skin damage, with the goal lowering your risk of skin cancer.  However, in the United States, the term suntan lotion usually means the opposite of sunscreen, and instead refers to lotion designed to moisturize and maximize UV exposure and tanning rather than block it.  These are commonly called indoor tanning lotions when designed for use with tanning beds or just suntan lotion if designed for outdoor use and may or may not have SPF protection in them.\nThe most effective sunscreens protect against both UVB (ultraviolet radiation with wavelength between 290 and 320 nanometres), which can cause sunburn, and UVA (between 320 and 400 nanometres), which damages the skin with more long-term effects, such as premature skin aging. Most sunscreens work by containing either an organic chemical compound that absorbs ultraviolet light (such as oxybenzone) or an opaque material that reflects light (such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide), or a combination of both.  Typically, absorptive materials are referred to as chemical blocks, whereas opaque materials are mineral or physical blocks.",

Many big cities have taxis.\nIn most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route.  Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go.\nRiding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport.",

Early trains used horse power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in England in the early 19th century. Long before railways, \"train\" meant any group of vehicles or pack animals traveling in a line, as in wagon train or camel train.  \nTrains contain the prime mover (either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The locomotive or railway engine (usually the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track. The last car you will see on a train is called the caboose. Some trains look like a special bus that can only drive on rails. Trains are used to carry people, as well as cargo, such as raw material,finished goods, and waste.",

Until 2004, foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there, and had to obtain an exit visa to return home.

        "content": "A snowmobile is a motorized vehicle used for travelling over snow.  It is like a car, only instead of wheels, it has treads.  Some snowmobiles have skis in the front for steering.  \nAdding snowmobile studs to the tread decreases the time and distance it takes to stop a snowmobile.  Once you make a decision to stop a snowmobile, the distance it will take to stop will be a combination of the speed of the machine, weight of the machine and the available friction and or the mechanical damping (which will equal the effective drag factor) between the snowmobile and the surface on which it is trying to stop. If the surface is icy or hard-packed, the mechanical damping portion of the effective drag factor is decreased, leaving you with only the friction provided by the tread to stop.\nSnowmobile studs made from steel or stainless steel with carbide tips are installed in the tread. The studs are designed for specific terrains in varying lengths, shapes and materials. The studs control acceleration, deceleration and maneuverability. The correct amount and type of stud installed in an effective pattern will produce the best traction results.",

In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing.  After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely.  There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years.  On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps.\nWhen the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence.\nThere is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.\n\n\n== References ==",

The American Falls and the Horseshoe Falls are separated with Goat Island, and the Bridal Veil Falls separated from the other waterfalls with Luna Island. Niagara falls is very well known for both its beauty and hydroelectric power. It is been a tourist attraction, commercial site and hydroelectricity source since the 19th century.\nIt is located near Niagara Falls, New York in the United States and Niagara Falls, Ontario in Canada.The volume of water approaching the falls during peak flow season may sometimes be as much as 225,000 cubic feet (6,400 m3) per second. The cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges.\nNiagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age). Water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean. The Escarpment has hard limestone on top and soft shale below.\nAlthough not very high, Niagara Falls is very wide, and is probably the most popular waterfall in the world. The Horseshoe Falls are the largest out of the three falls. It is named the Horseshoe Falls because it looks like a horse shoe. \nNiagara Falls is a very popular tourist destination and many people visit it on holiday in Canada.\nNiagara Falls is one Canada's proudest place.",

It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometres (13,171 miles) long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres (50 feet) high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals.\nNineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226\u2013200 BC by the first Emperor of Imperial China, Qin Shai Hong, during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty. (Qin pronounced like Chin).",

They lived there between 1200 and 1450 AD. Other people lived there before about 650 AD. \nThe Incas built houses, fields and temples by cutting the rock on the mountain so it was flat. They built an Observatory to look at the stars.\nWhen the Spanish invaded Peru, the Incas left Machu Picchu. Nobody knows for sure why they did that, but some think it was because of diseases from Europe. The city was left unfinished, most likely due to the Spanish invasion and/or a civil war between the ruling rival Inca brothers named Huascar and Atahualpa. The Spanish never found Machu Picchu or the lost city during their occupation.\nMachu Picchu is very difficult to get to because it is so high in the mountains. It has only one way in and a stone wall to protect it. Most people on Earth did not know it was there until a Yale graduate named Hiram Bingham rediscovered it in 1911. He heard rumours of a hidden city which was already known to the native Peruvians, who guided him there. He led a restoration project that was partly funded by the National Geographic Society. Bingham made a deal with the government to take artifacts to the Peabody Museum for study. Peru is still trying to have those artifacts returned to them.\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.\nToday, there is a new road so that tourists can visit. People can also walk along the Inca Trail, or take a train from Cusco.",
