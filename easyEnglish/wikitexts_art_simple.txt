When it is shaped and then fired in a kiln to make it hard, it becomes pottery.\nClay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains. There may also be some organic materials in the clay.\nThere are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). The thixotropy of clay sometimes causes landslides.\nQuartz, feldspars, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral. The formation of clay is well understood.  It can come from soil, volcanic ash, and glaciation.  Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily.Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. A clay particle is about 1/1000th the width of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement. Where the grains are more than a few millimeters wide, the material is called silt, not clay.\n\n\n== References ==",

Chemically, it is an inorganic compound of  metal, non-metal or metalloid atoms held together by chemical bonds. \nUp to the 1950s or so, the most important were the traditional clays, made into pottery, bricks, tiles and the like, also cements and glass. Clay-based ceramics are described in the article on pottery. A composite material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet. \nThe word ceramic can be an adjective, and can also be used as a noun to refer to a ceramic material, or a product of ceramic manufacture. Ceramics may also be used as a singular noun referring to the art of making things out of ceramic materials. The technology of manufacturing and usage of ceramic materials is part of the field of ceramic engineering.\nMany clay-based ceramic materials are hard, porous, and brittle. The study and development of ceramics includes methods to deal with these characteristics, to accentuate the strengths of the materials and investigate novel applications.",

Other artists like working with pencil or chalk. Sometimes charcoal can be used.  \nFamous paintings are often kept in art galleries, like the National Gallery in London and the Louvre (Paris) where one of the most famous paintings in the world hangs, the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci.  People do not have to go to a famous gallery to view art.  There are private art galleries in many cities around the world.\nThere is a basic difference between drawing and painting. In drawing, a single layer is the entire image. In painting, one layer is painted over another to get the final image. As a result, most of the time the image will not be clear until it gets to the final stage.\nThere are four basic stages in painting: preparation, divide, layer, and touchup.\n\nPreparation: most artists prepare a canvas or other surface. A thin uniform cover or \"wash\" of white or other colour is laid on the whole surface. This may help the later layers to get the same fix all over the surface. Also, the unseen wash may help the refection of light from the surface, thus improving the effect for the viewer. For really uneven or coloured surfaces, such as wood or rough canvas, a more substantial covering is needed. That is called gesso, traditionally a mixture of chalk and gelatin, but nowadays available as a thick white acrylic. Painting on some surfaces requires a special technique. Painting on plaster uses the fresco method.\nIn the divide stage, the canvas is divided into a few major areas (depending on the image you paint), and background for those areas are plotted.\nIn the layer stage, a layer is plotted over another layer, to get the desired shape in each area. By end of this stage, all objects in the image will be clearly identifiable.\nThe touchup stage needs extra effort. This stage is to provide an extra look to the image, like precise bordering, merging layers and other visual effects.",

It is a powder found in nature. It adds a blue color to paints and dyes.\nThe first synthetic dye was aniline. Aniline is an organic chemical compound produced in two stages from benzene. It gives a mauve color which was much used for dyeing clothes in the 19th century. It was invented in 1856 by  William Henry Perkin.

Firing makes the clay hard. The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again. The fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny, decorative and water-tight. \nSome potters make objects which are not useful and are really artistic objects or sculpture.

An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just \"impressions\". \nImpressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas.

The eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours, as well as orange, purple, pink, and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged. \nGeorges Seurat, at first an Impressionist painter, and Paul Signac, developed this technique in 1886. Other important artists were Camille Pissarro and, in some paintings, Vincent van Gogh.  Art critics who saw their work, laughed at it and called it \"Pointillism\" as an insult. This name is still used, but is no longer thought of as an insult.Traditionally, artists blend pigments (mix colours) on a palette. Pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all \u2013 they just use the colours straight from the tube. Traditional painters, and also impressionist painters, use many types of brushstrokes, and many textures of paint. The surface of the painting may have flat colour, lines, squiggles and dabs of paint. In a pointillist painting, every part of the picture is done in tiny dots, and most of the dots are about the same size. Pointillism is usually done in oil paints, because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas.",

Colours and shapes are not used in a way people see them, but as the artist feels them. \nExpressionism emerged as an 'avant-garde movement' in poetry and painting before the First World War. In the Weimar years it was appreciated by a mass audience, peaking in popularity in 1920s Berlin.\nExpressionism presents the world as subjective: how the artist feels it, not how it is scientifically. The art looks to get an emotional effect, and transmits personal moods and ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of \"being alive\" and emotional experience rather than physical reality.Expressionism is exhibited in many art forms, including: painting, literature, theatre, dance, film, architecture and music. The term often implies emotional angst. In a general sense, painters such El Greco could be called expressionist; in practice, the term is applied only to 20th century works.\nThe Expressionist stress on the individual perspective was also a reaction to positivism and other artistic movements such as naturalism and impressionism.Typical modern expressionists are Edvard Munch (The Scream), August Macke, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, Marc Chagall,  and others. The First World War, with the many young men who died, left deep impressions on artists' minds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

The mechanisation of hand work was opposed by the Luddite rebellion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Wood carving",
        "content": "Wood carving is a form of working wood by means of a cutting tool. A chisel or knife are usual tools: the chisel can be tapped with a wooden mallet. The result is a wooden figure, or the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. A 'wood carving' may also refer to the finished product.\nThe making of sculpture in wood has a long history. Wood survives much less well than the other materials such as stone and bronze. It is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. Therefore, we do not know much about wood in the art history of older cultures.   Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed.\nMany of the most important sculptures of China and Japan are in wood, also most African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions. Wood is light, so it is suitable for masks and other objects meant to be carried. It can take very fine detail, and is also much easier to work than stone.\nSome of the finest examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy and France, where the typical themes of that era were used in Christian icons. In England many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, when oak was often used. In general, really fine carving is done in fruitwood (wood of a fruit tree) because that is easy to work with. The famous woodcarver Grinling Gibbons used to work with lime wood. Complex pieces are often carved in separate sections which are later stuck together.",

Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he is often called a \"Renaissance Man\" which means that he had great talent in many areas.\nMichelangelo lived an extremely busy life, creating a great number of artworks. Some of Michelangelo's works are among the most famous that have ever been made. They include two very famous marble statues, the Pieta in Saint Peter's Basilica and David which once stood in a plazza in Florence but is now in the Accademia Gallery.  His most famous paintings are huge frescos, the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the Last Judgement. His most famous work of architecture is the east end and dome of Saint Peter's Basilica.\nA lot is known about Michelangelo's life because he left many letters, poems and journals. Because he was so famous, he became the very first artist to have his biography (story of his life) published while he was still living. His biographer, Giorgio Vasari, said that he was the greatest artist of the Renaissance. He was sometimes called Il Divino (\"the divine one\").\nOther artists said that he had terribilit\u00e0, (his works were so grand and full of strong emotion that they were scary). Many other artists who saw his work tried to have the same emotional quality. From this idea of terribilit\u00e0 came a style of art called Mannerism.",

A work of art is cubist when the artist opts to break up objects and reassemble them in abstract and geometric form. Picasso could draw and paint when he was very young. His first word was l\u00e1piz, the Spanish word for \"pencil\".Perhaps his most famous painting is Guernica, which shows the horrors of war after the bombing of the town of Guernica. He spent most of his life in France when he was an adult.\nHe was 90 years old when a number of his works were shown in an exhibition at the Louvre in Paris. He was the first living artist to have an exhibition at the Louvre.Picasso had four children with three women. He died of heart failure in Mougins, France, on April 8 1973.",

His father wanted him to help run the family's grocery business. However, Monet wanted to be an artist. When he was young he met the painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin who taught him to use oil paints, and encouraged him to paint out of doors.Monet joined the French Army in Algeria for two years from 1860-1862. When he became ill he left the army to study art at university. He did not like the way art was taught, and joined the painter Charles Gleyre in his studio. He met other artists here, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley. They shared their ideas about painting.\nIn 1866 Monet had a child with Camille Doncieux, who had been his model. They married in 1870 and had two children, Michel and Joseph. In 1870 he moved to England to escape the Franco-Prussian War, and in 1871 he moved to Argenteuil near Paris where he painted some of his most famous pictures. In 1873 he painted Impression, Sunrise, showing the sea at Le Havre. When this picture was shown in 1874 one critic took its title and called the group of artists \"Impressionists\". He intended to make fun of the artists, but the name has stuck and this is what people today call this style of painting.\nIn 1879 Camille died of tuberculosis. Alice Hosched\u00e9 decided to help Monet by taking care of his children as well as her own. In 1883 they moved to a house in Giverny where Monet planted a large garden. Monet married Alice in 1892.\nMonet found that his garden inspired him to paint pictures of it, particularly the water lilies. Alice died in 1911, and his son Jean was killed in World War I in 1914.\nMonet used broad brush strokes to build up his pictures, and painted quite quickly to try and get the idea of the light he could see into his paintings. If you go very close to one of his pictures it is hard to see what it shows, but if you stand back everything becomes clear.\nHis later paintings include series, in which he paints the same subject in different lights. For example, he painted a series of pictures of haystacks in a field, and another series of pictures of the west front of Rouen Cathedral. There are many paintings of the lilies in his garden at Giverny.",

Instead of blowing into a reed they vibrate their lips by buzzing them against a metal cup-shaped mouthpiece. The mouthpiece helps to amplify the buzzing, which creates the sound. Most brass instruments have valves attached to their long pipes; the valves look like buttons. Pressing on the valves makes them open and close different parts of the pipe.\nWith brass instruments, the sound starts at the lips.\nTheir mouthpieces just help your lips buzz. It does not matter if the instrument is really made of brass, as long as it works that way. \nIt is not important what the instrument is made of. Some brass instruments are really made of wood, but are still called brass instruments, like the serpent. Other instruments are made of brass but do not work like this, like the saxophone. They are not called brass instruments, because they don't work that way.\nThere are also parts of the instrument that change the resonance and thus the pitch, like slides or valves.\nA brass band is a group of brass instruments and drums that play music together. They are often used to play for parades and processions because the players can march and play at the same time. Brass bands were very popular in England. Many factories and coal mines had their own bands. The workers would play in the bands after work. One famous band is the Grimethorpe Colliery Band.",

        "content": "The clarinet is a woodwind instrument.\nThe clarinet body is made up of the mouthpiece, barrel, upper joint, pads, keys, ring key, rod, lower joint, and bell. The clarinet has one reed. The reed is made of cane, bamboo or plastic, which varies in thickness. The reed is attached to the mouthpiece with a clamp called a ligature, which is usually made out of metal.   Blowing through the mouthpiece makes the reed vibrate, and therefore makes the noise.  The body of the clarinet is a cylindrical tube with holes.  The holes are covered by the fingers to make musical notes.  There are also buttons pressed by the fingers which allow pads over holes to open or close so all notes of the chromatic scale can be played. The buttons are usually played with the \"pinkie\" finger.  \n\nOne kind of keyed clarinet is called the Albert system.  Another kind is called the Boehm system. The Boehm clarinet is much used by classical orchestras and by jazz musicians. In North America and other Western countries, the most popular clarinet is the clarinet pitched in B flat. This means that if a clarinet player plays a note that is written as a C, it sounds like a B flat on a piano. The B flat clarinet is used in concert, marching, and school bands.  Musicians in orchestras also play the A-clarinet (a semitone lower), the sopranino E flat clarinet (a fourth higher) and the Bass_clarinet  in B flat (sounding an octave lower).  \nA beginner clarinet player usually can play a note within the first minutes of a lesson. Making a sound with the clarinet is easier than making a sound with many other wind instruments. Most instrumental music teachers consider it to be a good instrument for young players as soon as the lower adult teeth have grown. The fingering system is very similar to the flute and the saxophone, so changing from playing the clarinet to one of these instruments is not too difficult after the student is comfortable playing the clarinet and has reached a certain level.\nA famous piece that features a clarinet is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, which has the clarinet playing the melody with the rest of the orchestra playing along. Written in 1791, it is often considered the first great composition for the instrument.",

A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier.\nThe violin is important in European and Arabian music. No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe. The modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By the time the modern orchestras started to form in the 17th century, the violin was nearly fully developed. It became the most important orchestral instrument - in fact, nearly half of the instruments in the orchestra is made up of violins, which are divided into two parts: \"first violins\" and \"second violins\". Nearly every composer wrote for the violin, whether as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music, folk music, and even in jazz.\nThe violin is sometimes called a \u201cfiddle\u201d.

A hardwood such as ebony or rosewood is used.\nCastanets are used in pairs.  Traditionally two pairs are played together, one pair held in each hand.  There is a string which passes through small holes in the shells.  The player winds the string around the thumb and finger so that the two shells can be clicked together.  The two pairs of castanets used are slightly different sizes so that they make a slightly different pitch. The higher pair, known as hembra (female), is usually held in the right hand, with the larger macho (male) pair held in the left.\nCastanets are traditionally played by singers and dancers.  Spanish folk dancers often use castanets.  They are often associated with flamenco dancing.\nWhen they are played in an orchestra they are often attached to a stand.  The technique of playing is therefore different.  They can be tapped by the fingers and palm of the hand.  They are often used in music which is supposed to sound Spanish.  In ballet and opera they are used to accompany Spanish dances.  Carmen, the character in Bizet's opera Carmen, sings a song and accompanies herself on the castanets.

Because it is made from brass it is often included in the brass section alongside true brass instruments like the trumpet or trombone.  However, it is not a true brass instrument but a member of the woodwind family of instruments because it has a reed. It was developed from the clarinet and shares many similarities to the clarinet. The player blows into a reed fitted into the mouthpiece of the instrument. Adolf Sax creates the instrument, but at first, it was heavily disliked because he boasted about it. Conductors  would not add it to their orchestras because of the horrible reputations it had because of Adolf Sax. It started to gain popularity and lose that bad review, in the early 20th century.   \nThe mouth piece is also a way to tune the saxophone. If you are sharp you can pull the mouthpiece out. If you are flat you can push the mouthpiece in. Another way to tune the saxophone is with your mouth. If you are sharp you 'drop your jaw', or loosen up. If you are flat you tighten your embouchure, (mouth).  \nThere are several different kinds of saxophone. In order from low to high pitch they are: tubax, contrabass, bass, baritone, tenor, alto, soprano, sopranino, and soprillo. However, only the baritone, tenor, alto, and soprano are commonly used.\nIt was invented in 1840 by Adolphe Sax and is used in classical, jazz, and occasionally in rock, pop, and other styles. The big bands of the 1940s and 1950s always used it too. Famous saxophone players were Marcel Mule (classical music), John Coltrane (jazz music), and Charlie Parker (jazz music).",

When this happens throughout the whole piece, it is called polyphonic music. Rounds and fugues are types of polyphonic music. If the other melody only happens sometimes, then the second melody is called a countermelody.\nThe adjective of melody is melodic. There is also the adjective melodious which means: 'a sweet-sounding melody'.  \nMusic that does not have an obvious melody may be hard to understand (unless it is focused on rhythm, such as a drum solo).\nMany melodies are easy to sing, while others are difficult to sing.

The first beat of a group of regular, evenly spaced beats usually feels stronger than the others.  When we write music down, we put each group in bars (or \u201cmeasures\u201d). \nRhythms can have different patterns which can be clapped or tapped.  In Western music, these patterns are common:  \n\n1 2, 1 2\n1 2 3, 1 2 3\n1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4.A conductor will beat time.  The rhythm will fit in to this regular beat.\nAll musicians have to have a good sense of rhythm.  To play or sing rhythmically they must keep a steady beat in their head (if playing alone), listen to the others players (if playing in groups) or watch the conductor (if there is one).\nPeople who are playing on their own can practise with a metronome to help them to play to a steady beat.  However, musicians also use rubato (rhythmic freedom), especially when playing music of a romantic nature.  One has to learn to let the music \u201cbreathe\u201d in the right way.  This is not the same as playing unrhythmically (badly).  It is something one learns with experience.\nFeeling the rhythm in music is basically human.  A person who has a stroke may lose language, but not the sense of rhythm.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks says that chimpanzees and other animals do not have a sense of rhythm.",

Someone who makes a special study of music theory is a music theorist.\nPeople who make their own music are composers. People who play or sing music are \u201cperformers\u201d. It is important for both composers and performers to understand what makes the music sound the way it does. In the times of the Ancient Greeks the famous philosopher Pythagoras tried to explain how instruments are tuned. He understood the science of the good vibrations that the instruments make and explained how and why the octave is divided into twelve parts(in some cultures).\nIn the Middle Ages there were several famous music theorists who wrote books about music theory. Their ideas are interesting for us because they tell us what people thought about music at that time.\nIn the 18th century some composers wrote books on music theory. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (son of the famous Johann Sebastian Bach) wrote a book called: \u201cAn Essay on the true art of playing the Keyboard\u201d. Leopold Mozart (the father of the famous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) wrote a book called The Art of Playing the Violin. Both these books were extremely well known in their day. In spite of their titles the first halves of these two books are both about a branch of music theory called \"performance practice\": They tell us a lot about how music was played in those days, how some rhythms were played quite freely and how ornaments in the music were played.\nToday people who want to compose will study music theory, perhaps at college or university school of music.  In a conservatory program, they study harmony and counterpoint as well as form; in other programs, they spend less time on the theories of the past. They will be taught \u201crules\u201d. These rules are not laws, they simply mean: the way that most great composers wrote music in the past. These rules describe what composers of the past did, rather than telling composers of today what to do -- in fact, music composed today can have completely different rules than the music of the past. \nMusic theory is important for people who perform music because all these things help people to understand the music they are playing.",

From a very early age, the young Mozart showed great musical talent. He toured Europe with his parents and older sister \"Nannerl\" for several years performing for royalty and the aristocratic elite.\nAs a young man, Mozart tried but failed to establish himself as a composer in Paris. He returned to Salzburg where he was briefly employed in the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg. He was restless, aware of his genius, and thought Salzburg too small for his talent. He relocated to Vienna where he met with some success. He married Constance Weber and fathered two sons. He died in Vienna after a brief but unknown illness.\nMozart wrote more than 600 musical works, all of the very highest quality. His works include the operas The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, Cos\u00ec fan tutte and The Magic Flute; the symphonies in E-flat major, G minor, and C major (\"Jupiter\"); concertos for piano, violin, and various wind instruments; and numerous chamber pieces, works for the church, minuets and other dances, songs, and the Requiem.

He was the most important composer in Italy at the end of the Baroque period. \nVivaldi wrote more than 400 concertos for various instruments, especially for the violin. The scores of 21 of his operas, including his first and last, are still intact. His most popular work is the group of four violin concertos called \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d.  Each concerto describes a season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. He is believed to be the inventor of the ritornello form. He was very famous for his piccolo compositions, such as Il gardellino.",
